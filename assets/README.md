# Assets (optional custom assets)

Icons and images used by the template are loaded from **`src/theme/slds-1/assets/`** (included with the SLDS 1 design system copy). No need to put anything here for the default template.

Use this `assets/` folder if you want to keep **custom** assets (e.g. a different avatar image or extra images) separate from the theme. To use a custom avatar, add your image here and point the header avatar in `src/index.html` to it, or add `avatar2.jpg` to `src/theme/slds-1/assets/images/`.
